## Professional Experience
`2019/03 - present`

_XTEAM Studio LLC, Software Engineer_

- Participate in developing and maintaining  the backend of our website with Spring framework 
- Build some slack bots to help maintainer interact with our system, which would send notifications to slack when something going wrong and provide options to them depending on the type of issue. I love doing this project, it's fun to build something that interacts with peoples.

`2018 - 2019/03`

_Boya Inc, Software Engineer_

I'm incharge of developing and maintaining the website crawling system, the goal here is to crawling for a specific information in variety URL, then actively send those information to registed consumers in minimum time.<br>
The diffucalty of the crawling website is that these days most of the them are generated dynamicly, sometimes they also denided request from non-browser client to prevent DDOS attack and crawlers. In that case we need to come up with some workaround like mock a regular http request with selenium or headless-chrome.

<br/>

`2016 - 2018`

_The Syscom group, Software Engineer_

- Setup CI/CD workflow with Gitlab, Jenkins and Docker. <br/>
Integrating modules in variety languages into one building workflow, which also deploy end product into different server including linux and windows.
- Involving in develope large-scale stock trading software system, with average a million request daily. The most crucial aspect of the stock trading system is time efficiency, we have to deliver the request to trading center faster than other competitor, so our entire design is mostly focused on reducing the processing time. 
	Since we are a small team, so I have been involving in a lot of the lifecycle phases:
	1. Systems design: brainstorming and survey the strategies to minimize processing time
	2. Development
	3. Integration and testing: makes tools to help integration test (setup IT enviroments)
	4. Deployment: deploy final product to clients, and help tranning them with the system knowledge, make trainning documents.
	5. Maintenance: cooperate with the clients, help them solving the obstacles.
<br/>In all of those phases, I think the most difficult part for me is to cooperate with the clients, I have to be able to communicate the people in different domain (sometimes have no technology background), also I have to be careful about not promising for the services outside of our contract, that's some advanced human interaction techniques to me, but I learn how to do that by mimicking my co-works, they show me how to nicely initiate efficient communications.
