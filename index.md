## Professional Experience

`Software Engineer, 2019/03 - present`

### XTEAM Studio LLC

- Developed and maintained the REST API back-end, implemented in a microservice with Spring-Boot paradigm which packed into docker image then distributed in GCP cloud environment.
- Build tools to increase efficiency: Build slack bots to help maintainer interact with our system, which would send notifications to slack when something is going wrong and provide options to maintainer depending on the type of issue. I love doing this project, it's fun to build something that interacts with people.

`Software Engineer, 2018 - 2019/03`

### Boya Inc

- Developed and maintained the lottery winning number crawling system with selenium: Crawl for specific information in a variety of URL, then actively send those information to registered consumers in minimum time.
The difficulty of this task is that most of websites are generated dynamically, sometimes they also denied the request from the non-browser client to prevent DDOS attacks and crawlers. In that case, we need to come up with some workaround like mock a regular HTTP request with selenium or headless-chrome.

`Software Engineer, 2016 - 2018`

### The Syscom group 

- Developed and maintained the stock trading system and payment system.
- Set up CI/CD workflow with Gitlab, Jenkins, and Docker. Integrating modules in various languages into one building workflow, which also deploy end product into different server including Linux and Windows.
- Since we are a small team, so I have been involving in a lot of the lifecycle phases:
1. Systems design: brainstorming and survey the strategies to minimize processing time
2. Development
3. Integration and testing: make tools to help integration test (setup IT environments)
4. Deployment: deploy the final product to clients, and help train them with the system knowledge, make training documents.
5. Maintenance: cooperate with the clients, help them solve the obstacles.
In all of those phases, I think the most difficult part for me is to cooperate with the clients, I have to be able to communicate the people in different domain, however, I learned a lot from my coworker, they show me how to nicely initiate efficient communications.

## Education
