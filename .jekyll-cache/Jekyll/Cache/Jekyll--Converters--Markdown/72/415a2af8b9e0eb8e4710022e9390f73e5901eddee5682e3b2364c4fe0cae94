<p><em>XTEAM Studio LLC, Software Engineer</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Participate in developing and maintaining  the backend of our website with Spring framework</li>
  <li>Build some slack bots to help maintainer interact with our system, which would send notifications to slack when something going wrong and provide options to them depending on the type of issue. I love doing this project, itâ€™s fun to build something that interacts with peoples.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Boya Inc, Software Engineer</em></p>

<p>Iâ€™m in charge of developing and maintaining the website crawling system, the goal here is to crawling for specific information in a variety URL, then actively send those information to registered consumers in minimum time.<br />
The difficulty of the crawling website is that these days most of them are generated dynamically, sometimes they also denied the request from the non-browser client to prevent DDOS attacks and crawlers. In that case, we need to come up with some workaround like mock a regular HTTP request with selenium or headless-chrome.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><em>The Syscom group, Software Engineer</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Set up CI/CD workflow with Gitlab, Jenkins, and Docker. <br />
Integrating modules in various languages into one building workflow, which also deploy end product into different server including Linux and Windows.</li>
  <li>Involving in develope large-scale stock trading software systems, with average a million requests daily. The most crucial aspect of the stock the trading system is time efficiency, we have to deliver the request to trading center faster than other competitors, so our entire design is mostly focused on reducing the processing time. 
  Since we are a small team, so I have been involving in a lot of the lifecycle phases:
    <ol>
      <li>Systems design: brainstorming and survey the strategies to minimize processing time</li>
      <li>Development</li>
      <li>Integration and testing: make tools to help integration test (setup IT environments)</li>
      <li>Deployment: deploy the final product to clients, and help train them with the system knowledge, make training documents.</li>
      <li>Maintenance: cooperate with the clients, help them solve the obstacles.
<br />In all of those phases, I think the most difficult part for me is to cooperate with the clients, I have to be able to communicate the people in different domain (sometimes have no technology background), also I have to be careful about not promising for the services outside of our contract, thatâ€™s some advanced human interaction techniques to me, but I learn how to do that by mimicking my co-works, they show me how to nicely initiate efficient communications.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<p>A middle layer web service to help APP frontend communicate with Cobol backend. Sending encrypted, signed Https requests to bank server. I learned how to customized block padding for encryption, secure Keys by storing them in the HSM server, initiate secure money transfer Https request to the bank, and the message transfer workflow in bank.</p>

<p><em>ISO8583 Parser</em></p>

<p>ISO8583 is a standard digital format using in the financial transaction, this parser constructs a message thatâ€™s in ISO8583 format from other format and vice versa. I learned how financial transactions got initiated, processed, eventually realized in this project.</p>
